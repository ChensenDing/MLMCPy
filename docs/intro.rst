Implementation of the Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) method in Python. (MLMCPy) is a software package developed to enable user-friendly utilization of the Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) approach for uncertainty quantification. A SROM is a low dimensional, discrete approximation to a random quantity that enables efficient and non-intrusive stochastic computations. With SROMPy, a user can easily generate a SROM to approximate a random variable or vector described by several different types of probability distributions using the Python programming language.  Once a SROM is constructed, the software also contains functionality to propagate uncertainty through a user-defined computational model to estimate expected values of one or more quantities of interest within a smaller time-frame than a standard Monte Carlo approach.
